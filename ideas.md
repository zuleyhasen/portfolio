  **Design Movement**: **Cyber-Minimalist Terminal**
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Code-First Aesthetic**: The interface mimics a high-end developer environment but stylized for visual appeal.
  2.  **Functionality as Beauty**: UI elements look like functional tools (status bars, command lines, data visualizations).
  3.  **Subtle Motion**: Animations are precise, mechanical, and snappy, resembling system processes.
  4.  **Information Density**: Content is presented efficiently, utilizing collapsible sections and modal overlays.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  -   **Base**: Deep Void Black (#050505) & Dark Slate (#121212)
  -   **Primary**: Electric Cyan (#00F0FF) for active elements and cursors.
  -   **Secondary**: Matrix Green (#00FF41) for success states and code snippets.
  -   **Accent**: Warning Orange (#FF5F00) for alerts or important CTAs.
  -   *Reasoning*: Evokes the feeling of a professional coding environment while maintaining a futuristic edge.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  -   **Bento Grid System**: Content is organized into modular, resizable blocks (like a tiling window manager).
  -   **Split-Screen**: Code/Technical details on one side, visual output/preview on the other.
  -   **Floating Command Bar**: A central input/navigation bar that is always accessible.

  **Signature Elements**:
  -   **Monospace Typography**: Extensive use of coding fonts for headers and details.
  -   **Syntax Highlighting**: Text colors mimic code syntax highlighting.
  -   **Cursor Effects**: Custom block cursor with a trailing ghost effect.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  -   **Keyboard Centric**: Navigation is fully accessible via keyboard shortcuts (hinted on screen).
  -   **Hover-to-Reveal**: Details expand or decode upon hovering.
  -   **Instant Feedback**: Every click results in immediate visual or auditory (subtle click sound) feedback.

  **Animation**:
  -   **Typewriter Effect**: Text appears character by character.
  -   **Glitch Transitions**: Scene changes involve digital distortion and chromatic aberration.
  -   **Slide & Snap**: Panels slide in and snap into place with mechanical precision.

  **Typography System**:
  -   **Primary (Headers/Code)**: 'JetBrains Mono' or 'Fira Code' (Monospace).
  -   **Secondary (Body)**: 'Inter' (Clean Sans-serif) for readability in long blocks.

  **Design Movement**: **Holographic Glass Interface**
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Depth & Layering**: The interface feels like a stack of floating glass panes in a 3D space.
  2.  **Ethereal Glow**: Light plays a crucial role, with elements emitting soft, ambient glows.
  3.  **Fluidity**: Everything flows like liquid light; transitions are smooth and organic.
  4.  **Transparency**: Backgrounds are blurred and semi-transparent, creating a sense of context and immersion.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  -   **Base**: Deep Indigo (#0A0A1A) & Midnight Blue (#101025)
  -   **Primary**: Neon Purple (#B026FF) & Hot Pink (#FF00CC) gradients.
  -   **Secondary**: Cyan Mist (#00FFFF) for highlights and edges.
  -   **Accent**: White (#FFFFFF) with high bloom for text and key icons.
  -   *Reasoning*: Creates a "Cyber / tech aesthetic" that is mature, elegant, and visually stunning, fitting the "Glassmorphism" requirement perfectly.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  -   **Free-Floating Canvas**: Elements are not bound to a rigid grid but float in a defined 3D space (Z-axis usage).
  -   **Central Hub**: A main "dashboard" or "orb" from which other sections branch out.
  -   **Parallax Scrolling**: Moving the mouse creates a parallax effect, shifting layers at different speeds.

  **Signature Elements**:
  -   **Frosted Glass Cards**: Content containers with backdrop-filter: blur and subtle white borders.
  -   **Glowing Orbs**: Background elements that move slowly and change color.
  -   **Thin Lines & Grids**: Delicate grid lines in the background to ground the floating elements.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  -   **Magnetic Hover**: Buttons and cards slightly pull towards the cursor.
  -   **Tilt Effects**: Cards tilt in 3D space based on mouse position.
  -   **Ripple Clicks**: Clicking creates a ripple of light that spreads across the surface.

  **Animation**:
  -   **Float & Drift**: Idle elements gently float up and down.
  -   **Blur In/Out**: Transitions involve blurring content into clarity.
  -   **Light Sweep**: A beam of light sweeps across edges to highlight them.

  **Typography System**:
  -   **Primary (Headers)**: 'Space Grotesk' or 'Syne' (Futuristic Sans).
  -   **Secondary (Body)**: 'Outfit' or 'Plus Jakarta Sans' (Geometric Sans).

  **Design Movement**: **Retro-Future Synthwave**
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Nostalgic Futurism**: 80s vision of the future, but polished with modern rendering techniques.
  2.  **Grid & Perspective**: Strong emphasis on perspective grids (sunsets, landscapes) leading into the horizon.
  3.  **High Contrast**: Dark backgrounds with intensely bright neon vectors.
  4.  **Analog Warmth**: Subtle CRT scanlines, chromatic aberration, and noise to add texture.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  -   **Base**: Dark Violet (#1A0B2E) & Deep Space (#0D0221)
  -   **Primary**: Sunset Orange (#FF9E00) to Magenta (#FF007F) gradients.
  -   **Secondary**: Laser Blue (#00E5FF) for grids and technical data.
  -   **Accent**: Bright Yellow (#FFFF00) for sparks and attention.
  -   *Reasoning*: Captures the "playful" aspect while remaining "tech-focused" and visually distinct.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  -   **Horizon-Based**: The layout implies a ground plane and a sky, with content rising from the horizon.
  -   **Arcade UI**: Menus and stats resemble high-score screens or HUDs from classic arcade games.
  -   **Perspective Scroll**: Scrolling moves the user "forward" into the landscape rather than down.

  **Signature Elements**:
  -   **Wireframe Graphics**: 3D objects rendered as glowing wireframes.
  -   **Retro Sun**: The classic synthwave sun (striped circle) as a background anchor.
  -   **CRT Effects**: Optional toggle for scanlines and slight screen curvature.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  -   **Arcade Sound Design**: Satisfying "blip" and "select" sounds (optional).
  -   **Press & Hold**: Actions might require a "charge up" press.
  -   **Joystick Feel**: Navigation feels like steering rather than pointing.

  **Animation**:
  -   **Scanline Wipe**: Transitions look like a TV turning off/on.
  -   **Wireframe Build**: Objects construct themselves from lines to solid forms.
  -   **Neon Flicker**: Text or borders occasionally flicker like a failing neon sign.

  **Typography System**:
  -   **Primary (Headers)**: 'Press Start 2P' (Pixel) or 'Orbitron' (Sci-Fi).
  -   **Secondary (Body)**: 'Rajdhani' (Squared Sans) for technical readability.
